StyloSense is a platform that links consumers with tailors and offers outfit recommendations tailored to the user's skin tone.

## System Architecture

![SystemArchitecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fA2WUI5kg_pJ1R1iorJ31m1vEQig9Sce/view?usp=sharing)

Model–view–presenter (MVP) is a derivation of the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern which mostly used for building user interfaces. In MVP, the presenter assumes the functionality of the “middle-man”. In MVP, all presentation logic is pushed to the presenter.

## Model
In an application with a good layered architecture, this model would only be the gateway to the domain layer or business logic.

## View
The View, usually implemented by an Activity, will contain a reference to the presenter.

## Present
The Presenter is responsible to act as the middle man between View and Model. It retrieves data from the Model and returns it formatted to the View.
